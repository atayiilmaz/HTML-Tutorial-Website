# HTML_Tutorial_Website
Basic website using HTML&amp;CSS

  It's my first assignment for Internet Based Programming Lecture. The project includes 14 HTML file, 1 CSS file and a mockup file.
www.moqups.com has been used for creating the mockup.
  I preferred using a dropdown menu top of the page. It seems very cool. It's my first html project so there are no javascript codes
but i can develop the project on the following days.
